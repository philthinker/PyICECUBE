v0.0.1 (beta)

## Introduction

PyICECUBE is the python counterpart of ICECUBE-VREPToolbox that is designed for acceleration of V-REP + Python applications development. You DO NOT have to learn Lua language to make V-REP simulations tick! Some V-REP scenes are built exclusively for Python remote operation that can be found in the repository.

- The toolbox has been tested on **Anaconda 3.X** and **V-REP 3.5.0**.

- It works on Windows x64 only.

- It depends on the **ICECUBE Communication Protocol v2.0**.

- No more python module required.

## Install

- Copy the codes in the folder 'Lua' to the V-REP scene.

- Clone the master branch anywhere you want.

## Demo

There are two demos as well as two V-REP scenes available:

 1. Open the "UR5PickAndPlace.ttt" scene and run "Demo\HelloICECUBE_PickAndPlace.py".

 2. Open the "UR5PegInHole.ttt" scene and run "Demo\HelloICECUBE_PegInHole.py".
